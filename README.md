# Robotic RenAIssance

## Description
For our project 3, our team created an aplication called Robotic RenAIssance that incorporates React for the front-end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, and MongoDB with the Mongoose ODM for the database. The project utilizes queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data, and includes user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. The application is deployed using Heroku with data and features a polished, responsive, and interactive UI. The repository meets quality coding standards with proper file structure and naming conventions.
